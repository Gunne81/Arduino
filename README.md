NRF24L01+ Arduino low power sensors
=======
See http://iot-playground.com/ for details 

nRF24L01 is a single chip radio transceiver for the world wide 2.4 - 2.5 GHz ISM
band. The transceiver consists of a fully integrated frequency synthesizer, a power
amplifier, a crystal oscillator, a demodulator, modulator and Enhanced ShockBurst™
protocol engine. Output power, frequency channels, and protocol setup are easily
programmable through a SPI interface. Current consumption is very low, only 9.0mA
at an output power of -6dBm and 12.3mA in RX mode. Built-in Power Down and
Standby modes makes power saving easily realizable. 

Minimum supply voltage 1.9 V

Maximum output power 0 dBm

Maximum data rate 2000 kbps

Supply current in TX mode @ 0dBm output power 11.3 mA

Supply current in RX mode @ 2000 kbps 12.3 mA

Temperature range -40 to +85 °C

Sensitivity @ 1000 kbps -85 dBm
